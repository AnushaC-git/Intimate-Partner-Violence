# Intimate-Partner-Violence

This repository contains the code and data file for executing the data analysis.

The data required for our analysis is in the form of a TRS for Intimate Partner Violence surveillence in Kalamazoo county in the US. This data is shown in the beginning of the data analysis code.

The data analysis codes are as follows:

1.IPV_Fixed Effect_Jeff_Code: Data Analysis code under Prior I.

2.IPV_Fixed Effect_Binom_Code: Data Analysis code under Prior II.

Each of these codes will reproduce required estimates and trace plots.

If the user wishes to use this code for a different dataset they may do so by updating the TRS data and may set the initial values and the number of iterations accordingly in the code.
