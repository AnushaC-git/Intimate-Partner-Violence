# Intimate-Partner-Violence

This repository contains the code and data file for executing the data analysis.

The data required for our analysis contains TRS data for Intimate Partner Violence surveillence in Kalamazoo county in the US and is stored as a txt file named 'Intimate Partner Violence Data.csv'. This must be read in the beginning of the data analysis code.

The data analysis codes are as follows:

1.IPV_Fixed Effect_Jeff_Code: Data Analysis code under Prior I.

2.IPV_Fixed Effect_Binom_Code: Data Analysis code under Prior II.

Each of these codes will reproduce required estimates and trace plots.

If the user wishes to use this code for a different dataset they may do so by replicating the dataset in the form of TRS (as shown in the above mentioned txt file) and may tune the parameters accordingly in the code.
